# SHS Computer Science Club

This is the main website for the Stevenson High School Computer Science Club.

## Members Page

Don't see your name on the members page? That either means it's not done or your membership in this organization isn't public. If you want to start appearing on the members page, perform the following steps and wait a few minutes for magic to happen.

1. Go to the [SHS CS Club Organization](https://github.com/SHSCSclub) on Github.
2. Click the [People](https://github.com/orgs/SHSCSclub/people) link to the right side.
3. Find your own username, and change :lock: Private to :unlock: Public.

Now you should appear on the members page.

### How does this work?

The members page is using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), which lets applications access data from Github's database. To respect people's privacy, only members which have indicated that their membership in an organization is public will be listed.
